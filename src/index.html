    <p id="p1"> 
    my name is Jonathan, 26 years old. I live with 
    my wife and my baby. I have two dogs and I love
    to be at home sharing time with them; and since
    I see the programming course in CodeYourFuture 
    I'm hoping to learn to design and find a remote
    job.

  <p id="p2"> 
    since when I was a young I've been
    interested in videogames, computer programs 
    and music. I was an accountant and in the 
    At the university, I learned the fundamentals of SQL and VBA 
    and I got more interested in learning more 
    about programming. I did some project by 
    my own in BVA. I also like to play guitar
    in my free time.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p id="p3"> 
    During my career as an accountant, I audited a
    business who bought an accounting program
    , everything was on the web, and I always 
    have the idea to do my project combining 
    with my business knowledge
